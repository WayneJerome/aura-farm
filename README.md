This fun mini project transforms any video into an old-school ASCII art animation and plays it in your terminal, synchronized with its audio! It extracts frames from a video, converts each frame into green-colored ASCII characters, and then displays them smoothly on a static terminal canvasâ€”no scrolling, just fluid retro-style playback. Perfect for showcasing visual creativity, terminal magic, or impressing friends with a Matrix-like vibe!
